## Mqtt-Client 

Name of jar: mqtt-client-1.7-uber.jar 

Licence: Mqtt-Client is covered by the ASL 2.0 licence. Apache commons aims to help the community by making and maintaining reusable java components. 
The Apache licence has open source software development, such that developers are free to build on top of code provided through apache commons for personal, company internal or commercial purposes. 
Credit must be given to apache and the author, and a copy of the licence must be included in the final product. 
The final product itself does not necessarily need to be open source or include the source of the apache software used. 
This allows a product to be made that does not need to pay royalties or allow viewing of the code used, minimizing identical products.
